## **About the Project**

My first React app! It is a pomodoro timer web app to put what I have learned into practice. The menu dropdown allows for custom settings of timer and break duration, how many sprints until break time, and sprint goal per day. No standard pomodoro tomato theme here. Welcome to Palmodoro!

(This is a work in progress)
